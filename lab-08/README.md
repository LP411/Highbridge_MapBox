## Overview

You will create a custom base map in Mapbox, or a slideshow in Cesium, for your area of interest centered on a feature of interest. In our lesson example, we are using landforms in the Red River Gorge. 

## Part I: Mapbox Map or Cesium Slideshow (10 pts)

If you have worked through the lesson, you are close to completing your lab and submitting your final project! We want to create a web map for our area of interest. This will be the launching off point for our final project, where we spend time adding the content that we've created over the semester to this page.


### Data files

* Use the files provided in the lesson
* OR, create an area of interest and at least one custom raster or vector layer, or a point cloud. (See previous labs.)


### Required specifications of the deliverable

1) The map must fulfill the following requirements:


> * Be either a Mapbox map or a Cesium slideshow.
> * Focus on an area of interest.
> * Show a custom vector or raster layer, or point cloud, for the area of interest.

2) Completed web page and map (*index.html* and/or *map.html*) in this repository.

> * Finish the *index.html* and *map.html* files in the *lesson-map* folder be adding the relevant code.
> * The web page must have a meaningful title (both in the header title element and in the h1 and h2 elements).
> * Verify that the pages are loading correctly by launching VS Code's Live Server.
> * Commit and push changes to the remote repository. Add the URL to this repository in the Module 08 Submission page on Canvas.


3) Final project

> * Using the map you just created, proceed to complete the [final project](../final-project/README.md) requirements.
